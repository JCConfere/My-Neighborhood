# **Welcome to My Neighborhood**

Thank you for visiting my repository and showing an interest in my final project for the Udacity Front End Nanodegree program. This application showcases 6 different locations in the Morgantown, Wv area that I have found to be recreationally beneficial to the community.

## How do I get this program to run on my computer?

There are a number of ways that we can go about getting this program onto your system and getting you set up to utilize its features.

Here on the repository screen, you will see a green button on the upper right hand side of the window.  This will allow you to either clone the repository or download the app as a zip file.

If you are planning on cloning the repository, you will have to make sure that you have the latest version of Node.js installed on your computer.  You can find a link to it here, http://www.nodejs.org/en/.

You're going to need to make sure that you have NPM.js on your PC, as well. You can find a link to it here http://www.npmjs.com.

Once you have navigated to the directory in which you would like to clone the project, you only need to type the following in order to clone the repository to your directory.

````
git clone https://github.com/JCConfere/My-Neighborhood.git

````

At this point you need to navigate into the newly created directory and type the following.

````
npm install

````
This will install all of the dependencies necessary to run the app on your machine. Once the installation process has finished, type the following into the command line.
````
npm start

````
This will open a web page in your browser where you can interact with the program.  If the window does not open (it may take a minute or two),
then you can navigate to the app by typing the following into the address bar of your web browser.

````
localhost:3000
````

At this point the app should be functioning and ready for you to try it out!

## Instructions for using My Neighborhood

When you first see the map, you'll notice six locations marked around the Morgantown, West Virginia area.  If you click on an individual marker, an InfoWindow will popup giving you a quick description of the area along with a picture of that locale that is being supplied by FourSquare.

If you click on the "hamburger" navigation icon in the upper left hand corner of the map, it will open a sidebar that gives you some options you can utilize. You will initially see a list of all the locations being displayed. If you click on that location, the marker will become animated and the InfoWindow will automatically open for you.  

If you would rather use the search option, click on the box and begin typing. As you type, the app will automatically filter the results to match the characters that you have entered into the search box.
